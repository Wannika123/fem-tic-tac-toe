## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript

### What I learned

- I have never encountered so many bugs before, and I learned that TypeScript can actually help. Without TS, it would have been much more frustrating.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/) - At first, I thought I would give up the hover effect, I really had no idea how to do it. But this article opens my vision of what React can do: we can package up behaviours in much the same way that we package UI elements. And actually, all of his articles are great, written with clear language. I learn A LOT from his blog.
